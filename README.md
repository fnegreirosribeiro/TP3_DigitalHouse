A Machine Learning model to predict the tip from a taxi trip was built using the Yellow Taxi trip dataset of 01/2022 from New York.

The dataset contained many observations and features. The main objective was to try to predict the magnitude of a tip, using features such as lenght of the trip, total duration, etc... Several models were built, including Unsupervised Machine Laearning algorithms.

The notebook is in Spanish. The data was downloaded from the link "https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page", and it is not provided here since the file is quite large.
